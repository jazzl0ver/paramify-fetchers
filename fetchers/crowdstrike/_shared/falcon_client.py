"""
Shared CrowdStrike Falcon API client for the crowdstrike fetcher category.

Falcon authenticates with OAuth2 client credentials: a client ID and secret are
exchanged at POST /oauth2/token for a bearer token valid ~30 minutes. Every
fetcher in this category needs that exchange, so it lives here.

Endpoint paths and parameter names in this module are taken from CrowdStrike's
own SDK (github.com/CrowdStrike/falconpy, src/falconpy/_endpoint/), not from
prose documentation.

Falcon has three pagination styles and this module covers all three:
  - offset token ("scroll")  — /devices/queries/devices-scroll/v1
  - after token              — /spotlight/combined/vulnerabilities/v1
  - integer offset           — /alerts/queries/alerts/v2, /policy/combined/*

Collection-failure convention (see docs/authoring_a_fetcher.md): a failed call
appends to `api_failures` and returns None rather than raising, so one bad
endpoint does not lose the evidence already collected. The caller exits
non-zero when `api_failures` is non-empty. Authentication failure is the one
exception — no call can succeed without a token, so it raises.

How this category is put together
---------------------------------
Read this first if you are picking the category up.

    fetchers/crowdstrike/
      _shared/falcon_client.py     <- you are here: API client + the shared entry point
      <evidence_set>/
        fetcher.py         <- collect() + summarize(), one evidence set each
        fetcher.yaml       <- the manifest the runner reads

Every fetcher is the same three pieces, and only the middle one is interesting:

1. **collect()** — build the client, call the endpoints, hand the records to
   summarize(), return `evidence(...)`. Usually under 30 lines, because
   everything generic lives here in _shared.
2. **summarize()** — turn raw API records into the numbers an assessor reads.
   This is where the judgement is, and where every bug this category has ever
   had was found.
3. **`sys.exit(run_fetcher(collect, "<name>.json", logger))`** — the whole entry
   point. Logging, .env, the output directory, the catch-all and the exit code
   are all in `run_fetcher` below.

Two rules that are not obvious and are load-bearing:

- **No fetcher decides pass or fail.** These report what is configured and name
  what a reviewer should look at. The verdict is Paramify's, downstream. If you
  find yourself writing `compliant: True`, stop.
- **An empty result and a broken collection must never look alike.** `status` is
  `success` or `partial_or_empty` — both are healthy, exit 0. A *fault* is
  `api_failures` being non-empty, which exits non-zero even if records came
  back. Most of the bugs found here were a partial collection reporting success,
  so this distinction is the thing to preserve when changing anything.

Adding a fetcher to this category: copy the smallest existing one, keep
collect() thin, put the thinking in summarize(), and add a test that fails if
your summary is wrong. Then break your own fix on purpose and check the test
actually catches it — that pass has caught three tests here that asserted
nothing.

        complete one.

        `offset` is last and accepted only as a string: `DomainSearchAfterPaging`
        types it as one, while the integer-offset endpoints handled by
        `paginate_offset` use the same name for a number.

        NOTE: `DomainSearchAfterPaging` carries both `next` and `offset` and the

        the more conventional of the two. **Confirm against a live tenant** — if
